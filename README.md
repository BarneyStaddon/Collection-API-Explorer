## Synopsis

This is a basic UX for a top level search of a museum's object collection. Currently, only a top level result count is shown, with the number of results attributed to pre-specified 'facets' accordingly. This facet list will be built on to provide a full results lists. 

## Motivation

This project demonstrates a simple interface built with React using a Flux architecture. The collections API just happens to have some interesting data.
